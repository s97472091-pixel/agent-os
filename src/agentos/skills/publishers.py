"""Allowlist of publishers that may carry brand identity on a skill card.

A ``SKILL.md`` is a plain text file that anyone can write and any hub can serve.
If the publisher block in its frontmatter were trusted verbatim, a third-party
skill could ship ``publisher: {id: robinhood, name: Robinhood}`` and inherit a
partner's name, link, and logo in the Skills UI — a phishing surface, not a
metadata feature.

So the frontmatter only *selects* a publisher; it never *describes* one. The
declared id is looked up in :data:`RECOGNIZED_PUBLISHERS`, and the allowlisted
record supplies every displayed field. An id that is not on the list resolves to
an empty publisher, which renders as an ordinary unbranded skill.

The allowlist alone is not enough, because it makes the *ids* forgeable instead
of the fields: any directory an operator drops into a skills path could declare
``publisher: {id: robinhood}`` and sit in the Partners group. So a manifest may
only select a publisher for itself when it ships inside the wheel — see
:func:`resolve_declared_publisher`. Every other skill gets its brand from the
hub catalog row that installed it, recorded in the lockfile
(``LockEntry.publisher_id``), which is why an installed partner skill such as
Bankr still shows its brand while a look-alike on disk does not.
